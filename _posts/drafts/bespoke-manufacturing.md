# Bespoke production

Bespoke production refers to creation of a product based on custom specifications. As the trend grows towards
a highly generalized person being able to direct the flow of knowledge into highly specialized directions,
manufacturing may be able to grow beyond the constraints of mass-production of identical products and into the
domain of individualized production while maintaining the same economy of scale as before

## State of production
State and trends

## Expert analysis
Jensen Huang - Don't learn to code...

## Theory
Including maintenance and monitoring

## Examples


## Possibilities


## Potential effects
benefits and drawbacks

## Potential revisions to economic modeling

What we might see is not less opportunities for jobs but less help required to pursue complex production processes,
including maintenance and monitoring cycles. What this may allow for is more well-balanced relationships between
producers and consumers with respect to the flow of valuable action

What would be really valuable to build now
are services that facilitate the development of bespoke production processes for individuals who would like to
take ownership over their own ideas but previously lacked in one of the key areas of production process management
