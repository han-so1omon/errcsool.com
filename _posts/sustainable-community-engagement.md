It is important to come to people from a position of power. They should be able to understand as easily as possible how you can help them. This applies to personal interactions as well as group interactions where you intend to establish yourself as useful and high-priority. In this blog, I elaborate on some personal theories regarding how to create sustainable paths of community engagement, applicable on a general level, such that all parties can benefit from each other, and that they can establish dependent relationships that are still robust to failure

# Closed-loop Sources and Sinks
My theory here will be applied to rational, social decision making (i.e. [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics)), but since my background and thus my reference is in dynamical systems, it is useful to define some fundamental ideas first that help me think through this problem

The introductory theoretical basis that I would like to establish here is of resource flow in a quantifiable space. Resource refers to a [dependent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables), and quantifiable space should be something like a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space), although I haven't conducted a formal analysis regarding the exact basis type. We can think of resources flowing around in different patterns, sometimes starting somewhere and going away, never to return. Other times, returning in what is known as a loop

A [closed-loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_controller) is a loop that is controlled based on feedback. This is in contrast to an [open-loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_controller), where the actions that create loops do not require feedback. Open loop would be like a clothes dryer that operates on a timer or a light switch that just goes on/off when you press it

## Defining Sources and Sinks
The terms source and sink, derived from [dynamical systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), refer to attraction towards some defined conclusion or repulsion away from that conclusion. For those interested in artificial intelligence, you may be more familiar with the terms maxima and minima. In order to achieve your best local non-linear classification, you need to follow the gradient from your current position up or down the hill to the top or bottom

A source is a place where flow goes outward. Picture you're sledding at the top of a hill, once you start down the hill you follow it all the way down

A sink is a place where flow goes inward. Picture you've just finished sledding and you're at the bottom of a hill. Everyone else who starts follows all the way down until they all meet up with you and you form a group

### Relationship to Graphs
More pure computer science folks will be familiar with the ideas of [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). I'm not fully sure, but I would bet a dynamical system is a subset of a graph system, although a dynamical system is better in many cases for visualization, physics-based explanation, and computation with many popular techniques such as differentiation

In [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)), the concept of a cycle is where you keep traveling along a path to new destinations until you arrive back at your original destination. The version of this for a dynamical system is a loop. Both graphs and dynamical systems can paint qualifiable variables as quantifiable variables

Consider the comparison of these two frameworks with the example: "when I turn the faucet on, the water gets hot"

*Graph theory version*
- Vertices: **cold water**, **hot water**
- Edges: **turn faucet on**, **wait**

*Dynamical systems version*
- Dependent variables: **water temperature**
- Independent variables: **faucet position**, **time**

# Service Dependencies
Now, let's get off of that tangent and get back to the economics. With a sustainable system, what we wish to establish is an environment where the individual participants can benefit from each other in the cases of success and failure, both as individuals and as representatives of an organization within the community. For this post, I will re-use the example of a community with service providers and consumers within a large town or small city (pop ~30,000). Logistically, in that town, assume around half of them are legally and physically able to work

The following questions are important to answer regarding economic sustainability:
- What can we provide to each other from within our own community?
- What can we consume from a service provider rooted outside of our community?
- What benefit is there to choosing a service within our community versus outside of our community?
- What happens when something needs repair, such as a business collapses or someone moves away?

**My theory here, which I intend to investigate further over time, is as follows:**
>__Communities that can provide all services rooted in the community and efficiently with respect to cross-community dependencies, allow for a high percentage of economic sustainability for individuals and organizations, where sustainability is defined as ability to survive, recover from failure, and pursue opportunities based on motivation rather than necessity__

## Money Flow and Investments
Let's say you have the following service providers:
1) Store owner
2) Technology services provider
3) Ad services provider
4) Sales service provider
5) Product manufacturer
6) Real estate provider
7) Investor
8) Employees

Let's start from the perspective of the store owner and derive a couple of potential economic systems

## System 1: Largely externally dependent
1) The store owner sells products mainly to community members
2) The store owner hires a web developer from outside the community, who in turn uses Amazon Web Services for technology infrastructure provision
3) The store owner uses Google Ads for ad services
4) The store owner uses Square for selling their product inventory
5) The store owner uses Amazon for procuring materials
6) The store owner rents the store space from a property management organization based outside of the community
7) The store owner receives investment from a private party outside of the community
8) The store owner hires employees that live outside of the community

## System 2: Largely internally dependent
1) The store owner sells products mainly to tourists
2) The store owner hires a web developer from within the community, who uses a hybrid cloud for technology infrastructure provision
3) The store owner uses local creators for ad services, who in turn use Instagram and Youtube for content creation
4) The store owner uses Square and Shopify for selling their product inventory. The store owner also uses ShipStation for shipping to outside of their community
5) The store owner uses Amazon for procuring materials
6) The store owner rents a space from an individual who owns a commercial property
7) The store owner receives investment from a community investment group
8) The store owner hires employees that live in the community

The first aspect of conversation is the flow of money as services are exchanged. In the first system, the one that is largely externally dependent, all items except for one lead to money being spent outside of the community. I refer to this as an economic source. Meaning that the owner does not have a clear mechanism to recoup assets except for from item 1), selling products to community members. However, this means that although the store owner is an economic sink with respect to this service, the economic source is the other community members. If you can expand the source/sink concept to classify the community as a single entity, considering no further context, the community is draining money. This is not sustainable on its own. The ideal scenario is to maintain an equilibrium of assets incoming versus outgoing at a minimum

Now consider the second system, where services for the store owner are largely dependent on providers internal to the community. In this case, money comes into the community from tourists and the store owner knows that it does immediately leave when they create advertisements, pay rent, etc. Even still, it is not clear exactly how the money gets back to the store owner except for item 1), only that now the money is conserved in some other part of the community temporarily. What we need to do is make a modification to item 1), where the consumers of the store owner also include community members. Now extrapolate this schema to other service providers in the community. What this yields is a system where money comes in from tourists or external consumers and then stays within the community as much as possible

The second aspect of conversation is that there are some aspects of the store owner's service provision infrastructure that seem unreasonable to substitute for an internal dependency, such as Instagram/Google Ads/Youtube, Square, or Amazon. This remains an open question as to how to best optimize for externally dependent relationships

The third interesting topic is that of investment-based ownership. This is one of the most interesting results from a community that is able to act as an economic sink via a distribution of internally dependent service providers. Investment basically allows for mostly passive revenue generation to a stakeholder associated with a service provider. Investment typically relies on very very robust (or otherwise trustworthy) bookkeeping infrastructure, though. This is why the securities exchange commission exists and why a large amount of investments come from capital groups. Local investment groups exist as well, and although I am not certain, I would guess that they typically consist of higher-economic-class individuals, and that there are many fears of legal or otherwise monetary disputes coming from investments from average or lower-economic-class individuals. To conclude my theory here, with much to be explored in the future, I believe that increased investments from investors internal to the community will increase the community's robustness to failure cases as well as provide for more opportunities for explorations on service provision that is based on motivation rather than necessity, including potentially with services that may have otherwise seemed impractical to provide
